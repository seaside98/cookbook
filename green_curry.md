Rating: 5 stars

Servings: 6

This recipe is super filling and delicious, while still being very healthy. I've chosen to remove all the spice, you could add some jalepeno or birdseye chili to the paste.

* 0.75c white rice per 2 servings

Cook the rice in a rice cooker.

* 3g or 1.25tsp cumin
* 3g coriander
* 1g white pepper
* 3g salt 

Grind to a powder in a mortal and pestle.

* 2-3" knob ginger, sliced
* 1 shallot, sliced
* 6 cloves garlic, sliced
* 1 green bell pepper, rough chopped
* 2 bunches cilantro, bottom stems removed
* Zest of 1 lime
* 0.5tsp turmeric
* All the spice powder from above


Add ingredients to a blender and pulse into as fine a paste as you can, using a tamper to push everything into the blades.

Heat vegetable oil in a dutch oven. Add curry paste. Stir and cook for 90 seconds.

* 2 13.5oz cans full fat coconut milk

Bring to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Transfer all the contents of the pot to a blender and blend on high until smooth. Return the curry to the pot.

* 1.5 Tbsp brown sugar 
* 1.75 Tbsp fish sauce

The following vegetables are all optional, choose a few of them to use or try some others!

* 2c green beans, trimmed and cut into 1in pieces
* 1 Japanese or Chinese eggplant, half of the skin removed and cubed 
* 2 zucchini, halved and sliced 0.25in thick
* 8oz mushrooms, preferably pan fried


Bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for 3 minutes or until veggies are 60-70% done.

* 1lb tilapia, cubed and seasoned with salt

Stir together, then cover and reduce heat to low to poach for 3 minutes. Adjust seasoning to taste.

Serve over rice. Optionally top with:

* Lime juice
* Thai basil
