This recipe is super filling and delicious, while still being very healthy. I've chosen to remove all the spice, you could add some jalepeno or birdseye chili to the paste.

## Recipe

### Rice

* 0.75c white rice per 2 servings

Cook the rice in a rice cooker.

### Curry Paste
* 3g or 1.25tsp cumin
* 3g coriander
* 1g white pepper
* 3g salt 

Grind to a powder in a mortal and pestle.

* 2-3" knob ginger, sliced
* 1 shallot, sliced
* 6 cloves garlic, sliced
* 1 green bell pepper, rough chopped
* 2 bunches cilantro, bottom stems removed
* Zest of 1 lime
* 0.5tsp turmeric
* All the spice powder from above


Add ingredients to a blender and pulse into as fine a paste as you can, using a tamper to push everything into the blades.


### Curry

Heat vegetable oil in a dutch oven. Add the curry paste. Stir and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add:
