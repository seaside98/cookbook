# Pizza

A comprehensive overview of pizza!

## Dough

For the all purpose flour, use 11.7% protein or similar. Can also use 00 flour.

### New York Style

* 180g flour per 12 inch pizza
* 90g flour per 8.5 inch pizza (personal)

#### Poolish
* 15% water
* pinch of yeast
* 15% all purpose flour

Let rest at room temperature for about 24 hours. 

Can substitute with 14% sourdough starter. Increase water to 56% and flour to 93%.

#### Dough
* 48% water
* 1.4% yeast
* 3% sugar
* 3% olive oil
* 85% all purpose flour
* 2% salt
* Poolish

Mix in a bowl until fully combined. Turn out onto a surface and knead for about 1.5 minutes. It should be somewhat developed but definitely not a full bread strength. Round the dough into a ball and put into a lightly olive oiled bowl and let rise for 45 minutes (maybe 30 in the summer). Divide the dough and shape into tight balls. Place on an oiled sheet tray and cover with plastic wrap. Place in the fridge for 24-48 hours.

#### Sourdough Dough
* 88% all purpose flour
* 6% whole wheat flour
* 2% salt
* 66% water
* 13% ripe sourdough starter

Combine and knead until fairly well developed. Cover in a bowl and bulk ferment for 2.5 hours at 78F. Perform 3 sets of 4 stretch-and-folds spaced 30 minutes apart. Shape into a tight ball and put into a olive oil greased bowl in the fridge overnight. The next morning, divide the dough and shape into tight balls. Placed on an oiled sheet tray and ferment at room temp for 5 hours. Place in the fridge until ready to bake.

### Shaping the Dough

Let the dough come up to room temperature while the oven preheats or a little longer. 

Flour the work surface and top of the dough. Press the dough out with your finger into an 8 inch round, leaving a one inch crust. Pop any large bubbles that form. Place your right hand into the one o'clock position and stretch the dough out with your left hand. Drape the dough over your right wrist and place it back down rotated 2-3 hours. Repeat until you have a 10 inch round. Place on a floured pizza peel. 

Top the pizza, then stretch out the edges to 12 inches. Top with a strong pinch of kosher or flakey salt!

### Baking the Pizza

#### Pizza Steel
Preheat the oven to 500F with a pizza steel on the center rack for 45 minutes. Make sure the pizza isn't stuck to the peel. Shimmy the edge of the pizza onto the steel, it will grip and allow you to pull the peel the rest of the way out. Bake for about 5 minutes, or until the outer crust is browned but not burnt.

#### Cast Iron
Oil the cast iron with olive oil. Press the dough out with oiled fingers as far as you can, leaving a one inch crust. Let rest for 15 minutes. Continue pressing all the way to the edge. Let rise until room temp and a bit bubbly. Preheat the oven to 500F (can use a steel if you have it). 

When topping, spread the cheese from edge to edge. Bake until the top looks good. Finish the bottom of the pizza on the stove top for a few more minutes if needed.


## Sauce

### Basic Red Sauce
* 1T olive oil
* 1T butter
* 2 cloves garlic minced

Gently sizzle garlic. Add: 

* 28oz can whole san marzano tomatoes
