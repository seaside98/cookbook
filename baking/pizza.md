# Pizza

A comprehensive overview of pizza!

## Dough

For the all purpose flour, use 11.7% protein or similar. Can also use 00 flour.

### New York Style

* 180g flour per 12 inch pizza
* 90g flour per 8.5 inch pizza (personal)

#### Poolish
* 15% water
* 0.04% yeast
* 15% all purpose flour

Let rest at room temperature for about 24 hours. 

Can substitute with 14% sourdough starter. Increase water to 56% and flour to 93%.

If omitting altogether, increase the water to 63% and flour to 100%. Brush the finished crust with garlic oil or it will be bland.

#### Dough
* 48% water
* 0.5% yeast for 24 hours, 0.25% yeast for 48 hours
* 3% sugar
* 3% olive oil
* 85% all purpose flour
* 2% salt
* Poolish
* 0.5-1% diastatic malt powder (optional) 

Mix in a bowl until fully combined. Turn out onto a surface and knead for about 1.5 minutes. It should be somewhat developed but definitely not a full bread strength. Round the dough into a ball and put into a lightly olive oiled bowl and let ferment for 30-45 minutes until risen 50%. Divide the dough and shape into tight balls. Place on an oiled sheet tray and cover with plastic wrap. Place in the fridge for 24-48 hours.

#### Sourdough Dough
* 12% ripe sourdough starter
* 66% water
* 3% sugar
* 3% olive oil
* 88% all purpose flour
* 6% whole wheat flour
* 2% salt

Combine and knead until fairly well developed. Perform 3 sets of 4 stretch-and-folds spaced 30 minutes apart. Let bulk ferment until risen 50%. Divide the dough and shape into tight balls without deflating. Place on an oiled sheet tray and cover with plastic wrap. Place in the fridge for 24-48 hours.

### Shaping the Dough

Let the dough come up to room temperature for 90 minutes. (For sourdough, let it come up to room temperature for 3 hours.)

Flour the work surface and top of the dough. Press the dough out with your finger into an 8 inch round, leaving a one inch crust. Pop any large bubbles that form. Place your right hand into the one o'clock position and stretch the dough out with your left hand. Drape the dough over your right wrist and place it back down rotated 2-3 hours. Repeat until you have a 10 inch round. Place on a floured pizza peel. 

Top the pizza, then stretch out the edges to 12 inches. Top with a strong pinch of kosher or flakey salt!

### Baking the Pizza

#### Pizza Steel
Preheat the oven to 500F with a pizza steel on the center rack for 45 minutes. Make sure the pizza isn't stuck to the peel. Shimmy the edge of the pizza onto the steel, it will grip and allow you to pull the peel the rest of the way out. Bake for about 5 minutes, or until the outer crust is browned but not burnt.

#### Cast Iron
Oil the cast iron with olive oil. Press the dough out with oiled fingers as far as you can, leaving a one inch crust. Let rest for 15 minutes. Continue pressing all the way to the edge. Let rise until room temp and a bit bubbly. Preheat the oven to 500F (can use a steel if you have it). 

When topping, spread the cheese from edge to edge. Bake until the top looks good. Finish the bottom of the pizza on the stove top for a few more minutes if needed.


## Sauce

### Basic Red Sauce
* 1T olive oil
* 1T butter
* 2 cloves garlic minced

Gently sizzle garlic. Add: 

* 28oz can whole san marzano tomatoes
* Pinch of red pepper flakes
* 1g dried oregano 
* 5g sugar

Crush with a potato masher until well broken down or blitz a few times in the can with an immersion blender. Bring to a simmer and reduce by half, around 30 minutes.

* Salt to taste

Makes a little more than you need for two 12 inch pizzas if using a lot of sauce. Realistically makes enough for 4 pizzas with a moderate amount of sauce.

### Sweeter Red Sauce
* 1 can (150g) tomato paste
* 150g water
* 1g salt
* 10g sugar
* 10g olive oil
* 1/4 tsp dried basil
* 1/4 tsp dried oregano
* 1g black pepper
* 1g garlic powder
* 1g onion powder

Mix together until fully combined.

Makes a little more than you need for two 12 inch pizzas.
