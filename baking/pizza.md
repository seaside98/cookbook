# Pizza

A comprehensive overview of pizza!

## Dough

For the all purpose flour, use 11.7% protein or similar.


### New York Style

180g flour per 12 inch pizza
90g flour per 8.5 inch pizza (personal)

#### Poolish
* 15% water
* pinch of yeast
* 15% all purpose flour

Let rest at room temperature for about 24 hours. 

Can substitute with 30% sourdough starter discard (or ripe, it will puff up a bunch in the fridge but cook fine).

#### Dough
* 48% water
* 1.4% yeast
* 3% sugar
* 3% olive oil
* 85% all purpose flour
* 2% salt
* Poolish

Mix in a bowl until fully combined. Turn out onto a surface and knead for about 1.5 minutes. It should be somewhat developed but definitely not a full bread strength. Round the dough into a ball and put into a lightly olive oiled bowl and let rise for 45 minutes (maybe 30 in the summer). Divide the dough and shape into tight balls. Place on an oiled sheet tray and cover with plastic wrap. Place in the fridge for 24-48 hours. Let the dough come up to room temp while the oven preheats.


## Sauce

### Basic Red Sauce
* 1T olive oil
* 1T butter
* 2 cloves garlic minced

Gently sizzle garlic. Add: 

* 28oz can whole san marzano tomatoes
* 1g chile flake
* 1g dried oregano 
* 5g sugar

Crush with a potato masher until well broken down or blitz a few times in the can with an immersion blender. Bring to a simmer and reduce by half, around 30 minutes.

* Salt to taste (3g)

Makes a little more than you need for two 12 inch pizzas.

* 10g sugar
