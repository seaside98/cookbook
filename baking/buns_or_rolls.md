# Buns or Rolls (Enriched Dough)

This is my favorite dough! It is better than every other type of enriched dough, combining elements of each of them. I think the tanzhong is a critical element for any soft dough, it prevents the dough from going stale so it is just as good left over.



## Recipe

* For a burger bun, use 56g flour
* For a roll, use 35g flour
* For a slider bun, use 30g flour

### Tangzhong
* 6% bread flour 
* 27% whole milk

Cook in a small pot over medium heat until thickened, then remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.

### Dough
* 35% whole milk, warmed to 100f
* 2% instant yeast 
* 94% Bread flour
* 10% granulated sugar (17% for rolls)
* 2% fine sea salt 
* 15% egg (1 is 50g)
* ~4% egg yolk (1 is 14g)
* Tangzhong mixture
* 12% unsalted butter, softened (1 tbsp is 14g)

Combine milk and yeast and allow yeast to bloom. Knead dough until smooth, adding the butter a bit at a time once everything else is combined. Proof until doubled. Divide and shape by pinching the dough together and then rolling into a ball. Proof about 30 minutes, not quite allowing dough to double.

* 1 egg (or leftover from dough)
* Splash of whole milk
* Sesame seeds for buns (optional)

Brush the dough with egg wash and top with sesame seeds if using.

Bake buns at 375 for 18 minutes on a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake rolls at 350 for 28 minutes in a greased dish.

If you are feeling extra fancy you can top the rolls with melted butter and flakey salt.

## Variations

### Whole Wheat Rolls

Replace 25% or 50% of the flour with whole wheat flour or white whole wheat flour.

### Sausage Kolaches

Use 25g flour per kolache. Increase the sugar to 20%. Add 0.6% vanilla extract. 

Divide into equal pieces and flatten into a rectangular shape. Fill each kolache with:
* 0.5oz cheddar cheese
* 1oz breakfast sausage, rolled into a 3in log and pan fried. Try increasing the maple syrup in the sausage!

Align on a baking sheet so there is about a half inch between the sides before the second proof.

Freeze for extended storage, the cheese starts to get weird over time.

_I wonder if there is a way to deep fry these like a donut, seems like it would be good._


### Cinnamon Rolls

Use 35g flour per roll. A 8in circle pan fits 7 rolls. A 20in circle pan fits 12 rolls.

After the first proof, roll the dough out to be 16in wide and about 0.5in thick. Try to keep the corners square. 

#### Filling

* 11% butter, softened
* 30% brown sugar
* 3% cinnamon

Mix the brown sugar and cinnamon. Spread the butter, then the sugar mix, leaving 1 inch bare at the bottom. Roll down the 16in side. Chop rolls with a swift motion of the bench scraper. Arrange in greased pan(s) and brush with egg wash.

#### Glaze
* 15% cream cheese
* 17% powdered sugar
* 1% vanilla

Whisk until smooth. Drizzle over the rolls after they come out of the oven.


### Pumpkin Cinnamon Rolls

The instructions are the same as **Cinnamon Rolls**. 
You can leave out the egg yolk, and optionally skip making the tangzhong. 
Replace the milk in the dough with:

* 40% whole milk if skipping tangzhong, 13% otherwise
* 34% pumpkin pur√©e

You can add a bit more milk if the dough is too dry.


### Hawaiian Rolls (WIP)

Replace the milk, sugar, and yeast in the dough (not the tangzhong) with:

* 5% whole milk
* 3% yeast
* 30% canned pineapple juice
* 1% vanilla extract
* 20% brown sugar

This dough will rise quite slowly, just give it time.

_Not sure whether to include milk in this or not, water could be used instead._

### Lihapiirakka (WIP)

Use 40g flour per pie.

#### Filling
* 1 Tbsp butter
* 1 yellow onion
* 1lb ground beef
* 1 cup cooked rice

Cook the onion and beef until browned. Season to taste with salt. Mix in the rice.

#### Pies
Roll each piece of dough into a flat circle. Fill with the filling and use water to seal edge. Crimp with a fork. After second proof, heat oil to 350 and fry until golden brown on each side.

Serve with ketchup.
