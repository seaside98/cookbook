Rating: 4 stars

Servings: 6

Very warm and tasty! It would be good with poached tilapia. I also want to try the manhattan clam chowder.

### Recipe
* 1T olive oil
* 4 slices thick cut bacon, small diced

In a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-low heat, add a 2T olive oil then bacon and render bacon for 5-7 minutes without browning. Add:

* 2.5T unsalted butter
* 0.5 large white onion, diced small
* 3 medium ribs celery, diced small
* 1 small bulb fennel, diced small
* 5 cloves of garlic, minced
* Strong pinch of salt

Sweat over medium heat for 10 minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add:

* 0.5c dry white wine 

Let most of the wine evaporate. Add:

* 1 8oz cans bottled clam juice 
* Juice from 3 6.5oz cans of minced clams (Snow brand, reserve the clams)
* 2.25c whole milk
* 0.5c water
* 11g corn starch, mixed into one of the liquids
* 2 bay leaves
* 2lb russet potatoes, peeled and diced into 0.5in cubes
* Strong pinch of salt

Lower heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10-12 minutes until potatoes are tender but have a bite, careful to keep the temperature at a simmer. Ladle a third of the soup into a blender and blend until creamy. Mix back into the pot. Add:

* Reserved clam
* 1.5T fish sauce

Adjust seasoning with salt.

### Serving

Garnish with oyster crackers and fresh cracked black pepper.
