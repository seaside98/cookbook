# Tomato Soup

Rating: 3 stars

Servings: 6

The oven gives an extra roasted flavor that is very nice. I wish there were fewer dirty dishes, but since you have to blend in batches there really isn't any way around it. 

## Recipe

* 2 28oz cans whole peeled tomato (Cento San Marzano)
* 1 medium red onion, chopped 
* 8 cloves sliced garlic
* 4T olive oil 
* 15g sugar
* 3c chicken stock and 15g salt (or 3c water and 3T Better Than Bouillon)
* 1T tomato paste

Stir everything together in a 13x9 baking dish. Roast at 450F for 1 hour, stirring halfway through.

Working in two batches, transfer to blender and blend on high until smooth. Pass through a fine mesh strainer into a dutch oven. Thin with additional liquid and keep warm over low heat.

## Serving

* Grilled cheese or cheese bread
* Parmigiano Reggiano, grated on microplane
* Black pepper

## Notes
* Grilled cheese is probably better than cheese bread. 
* Sourdough is good, but I do want to try a plain white bread.
* Brian swears by including American cheese, so give that a try.
* I don't think the butter/mayo/dijon mixture is all that necessary, at least not with sourdough.
