Servings: 4

I think there is something good here, but it needs some work. I think the sauce is quite good, and would make a good ranchero sauce! Homemade chips are essential.


## Chili Sauce
* 20 guajillo chiles (stem and seeds removed)
* 3 large roma fresh tomatoes, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic 

Add everything to a medium sauce pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, stir and press chiles to submerge, cover pot, and allow to soften off heat for 15 minutes. Add softened chiles and tomatoes into a blender along with 450mL of cooling liquid. Blend on high until very smooth. 

* 1 onion, diced 
* Pinch of salt

In a wide pan, fry in oil until softened. Add:

* Chili pur√©e
* 20g or 1.5Tbsp cider vinegar 
* 20g sugar or 2Tbsp
* 9g salt

Cook for 15 minutes until reduced by about 50%. Season to taste with salt.

## Lime Crema (Maybe optional?)
* 100g or 1/2c sour cream 
* 20-25g or 1 1/2Tbsp  fresh lime juice (Juice of 1 medium lime)
* Zest of 1/2 lime 
* Milk to thin

Chop lime zest well then mix together all ingredients. 


## Serving

It is important that everything is warm! Layer into a bowl:

* Handful fresh fried tortilla chips
* Large spoonful of chili sauce
* 1/4 avocado, cubed
* Lime crema
* 1 fried egg
* Cilantro leaves to garnish
