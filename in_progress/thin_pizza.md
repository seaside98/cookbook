Pizza Dough Ingredients
* 360g (3c) bread flour
* 40g (3T) cold butter
* 180g (3/4c) ice cold water, divided
* 5g (1 1/2t) yeast
* 7g (1 1/2t) salt

Pizza Dough Instructions:
1. In a food processor, combine the bread flour and cold butter. Pulse until the butter is broken down into small, gravel-like bits.
2. Dissolve the yeast in 90g (1/4c + 2T) of ice cold water and the salt in another 90g (1/4c + 2T) of ice cold water.
3. Add the yeast water and salt water to the flour-butter mixture in the food processor. Pulse for 20-30 seconds until the dough is evenly hydrated. Be careful not to overmix.
4. Transfer the dough onto a work surface and knead for 2 minutes until it forms a homogeneous ball.
5. Round the dough into a ball, place it in a bowl, cover, and ferment for 2 hours.
6. After 2 hours, divide the dough into two equal pieces. Perform a preshape by folding in the sides and rounding off the dough into a ball. Cover the dough balls and let them rest for 20 minutes to relax the gluten.
7. Press the dough ball flat with a pizza pan or large pot then roll out each dough ball into a 12” (30cm) round
8. Use a pizza docking tool or a fork to pierce the dough to prevent large bubbles from forming during baking.
9. Spray 2 pieces of parchment paper with olive oil pan spray and a generous amount of fine grind cornmeal and place rolled out pizza doughs on top. 
10. Place both doughs stacked on a sheet tray and refrigerate, uncovered, for 4-24 hours to cold ferment and develop a skin for a crispier crust. Preferably 24 hours.
