# Thin Crust Pizza (Chicago Style)

## Dough
* 360g bread flour
* 40g cold butter

In the bowl of a stand mixer, blend butter and flour with a pastry blender until the butter is broken down into small, gravel-like bits. Set the bowl in the freezer.

* 180g ice cold water, divided
* 5g yeast
* 7g salt

Dissolve the yeast in half of the water and the salt the other half. Add everything to the flour bowl. Beat with the paddle attachment until just combined. Knead by hand for 2 minutes until the dough is smooth and passes the tug test.

Round the dough into a ball, place it in a bowl, cover, and proof for 2 hours.

After 2 hours, divide the dough into two equal pieces. Perform a preshape by folding in the sides and rounding off the dough into a ball. Cover the dough balls and let them rest for 20 minutes to relax the gluten.

Flour the work surface. Flip a ball side up and press flat with a pizza pan or large pot until 6in across. Roll out each dough ball into a 12in round.

Use a pizza docking tool or a fork to pierce the dough to prevent large bubbles from forming during baking. Don't pierce all the way through the dough.

Spray 2 pieces of parchment paper with pan spray and a generous amount of fine grind cornmeal and place rolled out pizza doughs on top. 

Place both doughs stacked on a sheet tray and refrigerate, uncovered, for 4-24 hours to cold ferment and develop a skin for a crispier crust. Preferably 24 hours.
